# Backpropagation Neural Network

This repository hosts a backpropagation neural network built from scratch using only numpy and pandas. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of neural network construction, focusing on the implementation of backpropagation algorithms to train the model.


## Key Features
- **Custom Neural Network** :
  Developed using pure numpy for matrix operations and pandas for data handling.
- **Performance Comparison**
  Includes a comparative analysis with a Keras-based model to evaluate prediction accuracy and performance metrics.


## Motivation
This project is designed to provide a deeper understanding of neural networks, particularly the backpropagation technique, by building the entire process manually and then comparing it with the high-level abstraction provided by Keras.
Feel free to explore the code, and any contributions or suggestions to improve the implementation are welcome!
